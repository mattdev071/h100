    # Priority 1: Maximum accuracy capacity check (2 jobs for #1)
    if len(self.current_jobs) >= 2:
        return False, "At maximum accuracy capacity (2 jobs for #1)"
    
    # Priority 2: Time constraints (longer jobs for accuracy)
    if request.hours_to_complete > 96:  # Extended for maximum accuracy
        return False, "Job duration too long (>96 hours)"
    
    # Priority 3: Calculate maximum accuracy priority
    priority_score = self.calculate_maximum_accuracy_priority(request)
    
    # Accept if priority score is very high (ranking #1 focus)
    if priority_score > 0.85:  # Very high threshold for #1
        return True, f"Accepted for ranking #1 optimization - priority {priority_score:.3f}"
    else:
        return False, f"Priority {priority_score:.3f} below #1 threshold"
```

### **Maximum Accuracy Priority Calculation**
```python
def calculate_maximum_accuracy_priority(self, request: MinerTaskOffer) -> float:
    """Priority calculation optimized for ranking #1"""
    
    # Maximum accuracy weights
    task_weight = self.task_type_weights.get(request.task_type, 0.25)
    model_performance = self.model_family_performance.get(model_family, 0.75)
    task_success = self.task_success_rates.get(request.task_type, 0.90)
    
    # Maximum accuracy bonuses
    maximum_accuracy_bonus = 0.40  # High bonus for #1 focus
    h100_maximum_bonus = 0.35  # H100 x8 maximum advantage
    
    # Maximum accuracy priority formula
    priority = (task_weight * 0.15 + 
               model_performance * 0.15 + 
               task_success * 0.15 + 
               maximum_accuracy_bonus + 
               h100_maximum_bonus)
    
    return min(priority, 1.0)  # Cap at 100%
```
